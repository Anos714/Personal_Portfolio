# Personal_Portfolio
This project is my personal portfolio website, built from scratch using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. It features a fully responsive design that adapts to all screen sizes using CSS media queries, and includes dynamic, on-scroll animations powered by the Intersection Observer API in JavaScript.
